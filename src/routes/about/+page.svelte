<h1>About</h1>
<p>Sliver Complex is a personal lab belongs to Restent Ou and SliverRiver.</p>
<h2>Direction</h2>
<p>
	We focus on the production of every front-end project, which will finally be used on our website
	or others.
</p>
<p>
	We usually use Vue as the main front-end framework. At the same time, we sometimes use React and
	Svelte in other projects.
</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>
	Now, the GitHub organization of Sliver Complex hosts our website project, and its associated
	domain, <code>slirv.vip</code>, also provides some of the services that complement our website.
</p>
<p>
	However, we are glad to help others building their websites, such as personal homepage and blog,
	although our current capacity is still limited. <a
